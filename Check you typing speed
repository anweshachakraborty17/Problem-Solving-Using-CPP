Check you typing speed!

Cicily is organizing a typing competition. Each participant who clears the competition receives a certificate and a cash prize. The initial mark is ten. For each mistake made, one mark is reduced. If the participant's score is an absolute value, he/she will be rewarded. Can you help Cicily to write a program where she enters the id of a participant and the score obtained, and the program should print the result for that candidate.
Id and marks is of integer type.

Input (stdin)

132574
1

Output (stdout)

132574 is eligible for reward.

Answer:
CODE in C++
------------------

#include<iostream>

int main()

{

 int id,marks;

 std::cin>>id>>marks;

 if((marks>=0)&&(marks<=10))

 std::cout<<id<<" is eligible for reward.";

}
