Sizeof() operator
-------------------------------

Maya is interested to learn programming languages. When she is learning, she had a doubt on how to find the size of the variable. In C++, we have the sizeof() operator, which is used to get the size occupied by a variable or value. Now, write a C++ program to declare a variable of character, integer, float, and double type and print their respective sizes.
OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print the corresponding size of a character, integer, float and double.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

1

4

4

8



Answer:
CODE in C++
-----------------------

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

cout<<sizeof(char)<<endl;//1

cout<<sizeof(int)<<endl;//4

cout<<sizeof(float)<<endl;//4

cout<<sizeof(double)<<endl;//8

return 0;

}
